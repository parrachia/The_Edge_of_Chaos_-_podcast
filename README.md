# Introduction

Welcome to **The Edge of Chaos**, a podcast about new decentralized digital technologies and the people building them.  [Beth McCarthy](https://twitter.com/ontologymachine), [Adam Reese](https://twitter.com/OneAdamReese), [Theo Beutel](https://twitter.com/theobtl), and [Pedro Parrachia](https://twitter.com/parrachia), all members of **DAOincubator**, are starting this project as a way to compile in-depth, multifaceted research and insight on topics relevant to the DAO sphere.   

For that reason, weâ€™ve chosen a special format for this show: each season will focus on a particular theme, so that during each episode of the season, we can approach the subject from a different angle, usually with the help of an invited guest.  We post all our episodes both in audio form and publish a text summary, so that you can choose how to consume them.

If you want to suggest a theme, appear on the show, join us, or talk to us about something you heard on the show, please reach out to us [here](mailto:contact@daoincubator.org) or simply on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EdgeOChaos).
